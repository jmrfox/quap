# quap
Tools for researchers working on auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo simulations of atomic nuclei.

At present, `quap` is not for performing a full Monte Carlo calculation, but rather testing important parts of the calculation on their own to facilitate research.

The core components of `quap` are fermion states and operators allowing for calculations in the full many-body basis and in the uncorrelated "one-body" basis. Being able to compare these two is crucial for further development of nuclear AFDMC.
